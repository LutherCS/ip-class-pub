# Use OAuth for user Authorization

The purpose of this project is for you to work with various tools (`openssl`, `flask` etc) to enable access to your web application over HTTPS and user authorization using OAuth. Follow the tutorials and make the necessary changes to your application as you copy/paste commands and code snippets.

## Seize Domain Name

You must control a domain name for the certificate (and the OAuth) to make sense and work properly. The easiest way to commandeer a domain is to edit `/etc/hosts` file on Ubuntu or `c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\` on Windows. Adding the following line to that file will redirect any requests for *roman.luther.edu* to *127.4.6.1* (localhost).

Use your own name and address (anything in the 127/8 subnet is a `localhost`, I chose 4.6.1 because it's almost 460).

```bash
127.4.6.1       roman.luther.edu
```

## Configure TLS on a Local Web server

Estimated time: 0-15 minutes

Follow the tutorial on DigitalOcean and create a self-signed certificate for Apache on Ubuntu 18.04. The resulting certificate should be similar to the *norse-panda* certificate. *Use your own name and location*!

You can skip this step as Grinberg shows the same command.

## Run Flask over HTTPS

Estimated time: 15 minutes

Read Grinberg's tutorial and add the generated key and certificate to your Flask app for it to be accessible over HTTPS.

## Enable and Use OAuth

Estimated time: 60 minutes

Follow the RealPython tutorial to enable OAuth and get access to basic user information.

The result should look as follows:

## (Optional) Get a Real TLS Certificate

Estimated time: 5-500 minutes

Follow the tutorial on Let's Encrypt and the tool they recommend, `Certbot`, to generate a certificate signed by a proper Certificate Authority.

Using Let's Encrypt is optional but highly recommended.

## Deliverables

Push code, the certificate, and a gif of the login process to GitHub. I used peek on Ubuntu to record my gif.
