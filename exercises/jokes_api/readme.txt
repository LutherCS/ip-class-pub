You can find my application at http://knuth.luther.edu/~mantno01/index.html

My flask server is being hosted at mantno01.pythonanywhere.com

You'll notice that the Get Joke By Number button is still not working. It returns an error that says:
  
    SyntaxError: "JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data"
    
I've tried all sorts of fixes and workarounds but cannot seem to identify the problem. It lies somewhere in getSpecificNumber in 
flask_app.py but I have yet to figure out what is causing the issue.
