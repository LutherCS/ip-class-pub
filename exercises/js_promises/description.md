# JavaScript Promises

## Task

1. Work inside the *js_promises* directory.

2. Create a proper directory structure (css for CSS files, js for JavaScript).

3. Create a page with a *text input* field, a *button*, and a *checkbox*. When the button is clicked, read a number from the field and generate page content based on the data received from [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/).

4. You should include information about the **3** (three) numbers: the one entered by the user (*n*), one less than that (*n-1*), and one greater than that (*n+1*).

5. If the *checkbox* is checked, retrieve data in one batch request (notice the slight delay in the demo).

6. Use JavaScript Promises to send requests and parse the JSON response to generate HTML content.

7. Use Bootstrap and/or CSS to style your application.
