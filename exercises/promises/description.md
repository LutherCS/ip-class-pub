# JavaScript Promises

## Task

1. Work inside the *js_promises* directory.
2. Create a proper directory structure (*css* for CSS files, *js* for JavaScript).
3. Create a page with a *number* input field, a *checkbox*, and a *button*. When the button is clicked, read a number from the field and generate page content based on the data received from [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com/).
4. You should include information about *3* (three) numbers: the one entered by the user (*n*), one less than that (*n-1*), and one greater than that (*n+1*).
5. Make sure to add the results to the existing `div` with the `id` of `number_info`.
6. If the checkbox is checked, retrieve data in **one** batch request (notice the slight delay in the demo as information appears without the batch option selected).
7. Use JavaScript Promises to send requests and parse the JSON response to generate HTML content.
8. Use Bulma to style your application.
