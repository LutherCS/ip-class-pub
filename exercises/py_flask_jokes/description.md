# Using Flask for Fun

Use Flask and [pyjokes](https://github.com/pyjokes/pyjokes) to build a web application that would allow users to select category of jokes (neutral or Chuck Norris) and print 1 (one) joke from the selected category. The resulting page should contain a link back home.

Add one of the following features to the initial application:

1. Use Bootstrap to style the app
1. Allow users to select the joke language
