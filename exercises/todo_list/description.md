# List design

Implement the following TODO List functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Use of Bulma (from CDN) is required.

## Functionality

| Element     | Type     | Comment                                  |
| ----------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Title       | text     | required                                 |
| Assigned to | select   | pre-populated in JS                      |
| Priority    | select   | pre-populated, determines color of a row |
| Due date    | date     | required                                 |
| Add task    | button   | validates the form and adds a new row    |
| Checkbox    | checkbox | removes a row from the table             |

You can hard-code the list of team members and priorities to populate the *Assigned to* and *Priority* drop-down menus respectively.

## Hints and ideas

1. Validate user input to ensure valid values are entered
2. Use custom `style.css` to highlight tasks based on priority
3. HTML elements have been stripped of classes but you can add them back. Don't change the *id*.
4. Look at the *GPA Calculator* for the ways to populate `select` elements.
