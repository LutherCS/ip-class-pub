## Cookies

One downside is that cookies are sent to the server with **each** request. Can be made server-readable only, so the client could not alter the values. Cookie token can be used to authenticat a user to a server.

```text
Set-Cookie: name=value; Expires=Wed, 09 Jun 2021 07:21:14 GMT; Path=/
```

## Local storage

New way to store data on the client side. Can be used as a (large) dictionary (key-value pairs). Editable.

* Add a value

```javascript
window.localStorage.setItem('course', 'CS330')
```

* Retrieve a value

```javascript
window.localStorage.getItem('course')
```

* Delete a value

```javascript
window.localStorage.removeItem('course')
```

* Clear local storage

```javascript
window.localStorage.clear()
```

## Session storage

Similar to *local storage* but limited to a tab and expire automatically on tab close.

```javascript
window.sessionStorage.setItem('course', 'CS330')
```
