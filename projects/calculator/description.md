# Calculator

Implement a simple calculator that performs the following operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## HTML elements

- `#result`: an empty `div` to display an expression and the result
- Buttons
  - 10 digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0)
  - A decimal point (.)
  - 4 operations (+, -, *, /)
  - Clear screen (C)
  - Evaluate (=)

## JavaScript elements

- `outputScreen`: a virtual calculator screen that holds the expressions and the result.

## Styling

Use of a framework (Bulma or Bootstrap) is optional but highly encouraged.
Bulma css is linked.

## Functionality

Operations are performed on floating-point numbers and the results may be presented in scientific notation.
Let JavaScript handle the math.

## Acceptable limitations

Use positive numbers in the expression. The result may be negative though.

## Submitting the assignment

Complete files *index.html*, *main.js*, and *site.css* in the **projects/calculator** directory of the repository.
Push the updated files to your private repository.
