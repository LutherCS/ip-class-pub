# Final Project

Your final project is an original, functional, deployed web application that uses *Flask* framework with properly designed user interface, programming logic, data storage, and API.
You are going to develop a three-tier application (front/view, back/controller, and the database/model) with front and back communicating via API calls.
It can be a project based around almost anything as long as it meets the following criteria.

## Requirements

1. **User interface: design**
   - Aesthetically appealing and consistent
   - *Bulma*, *Bootstrap*, or another framework is used
1. **User interface: interactivity**
   - Both `GET` and `POST` methods are used
   - `JSON` is retrieved and parsed
1. **User interface: error handling**
   - User input is validated
1. **Programming logic: methods**
   - Both `GET` and `POST` methods are handled
   - Valid `JSON` is returned to the front-end, if requested
1. **Programming logic: database**
    - `SQLAlchemy` or properly formatted and parametrized queries are used to access the database
1. **Programming logic: error handling**
   - User input is validated
   - `404: Not Found` and similar errors are handled
1. **Persistent data: tool**
   - A database (*SQLite*, *PostgreSQL*, or other) is used
1. **Persistent data: model**
   - The database has three tables/collections
   - The tables must be related (i.e. using *foreign keys*)
1. **Persistent data: complexity**
   - There must be at least one query that uses `join` to query multiple tables/collections
1. **Application: originality**
   - Use your imagination and solve *your* problem
1. **Application: deployment**
   - Deployed and publicly available
1. **Application: complexity**. One of the following:
   - Use *ReactJS*, *Vue*, or another JavaScript framework
   - Add authentication using *OAuth*
   - Use *MongoDB* or another document database instead of a relational database
