# Final Project

Your final project is an original, functional web application that uses *Flask* framework with properly designed user interface, programming logic, data storage, and API. It can be a project based around almost anything as long as it meets the following criteria.

## Requirements

* **User interface: view**
  * At least three templates
* **User interface: design**
  * Aesthetically appealing and consistent
  * Use *Bootstrap*, *MUI*, or another framework
* **User interface: interactivity**
  * Use forms and validate user input
  * Use both *GET* and *POST* methods
* **Programming logic: controller**
  * At least three routes
  * Use both *GET* and *POST* methods
* **Persistent data: database**
  * Use a database (*SQLite*, *PostgreSQL*, ot other) for persistent data storage
  * Use *psycopg2*, *records*, or other Python package to access the database
* **Persistent data: model**
  * At least three tables in a database
  * The tables must be related using *foreign keys*
  * There must be at least one query that uses `join` to query multiple tables.
* **Persistent data: API**
  * Provide access to *some part of* your data via API
  * Demonstrate this functionality using a sample client application
* **Application: originality**
  * Use your imagination and solve *your* problem
* **Application: functionality**
  * Does not crash
  * Displays meaningful error messages
  * Validates user input
  * Returns correct results
* **Application: deployment**
  * Deployed and publicly available
  * Use *Netlify*, *PythonAnywhere*, or other platform
* **Application: complexity**. One of the following:
  * Use *Vue* or another JavaScript framework
  * Use *requests* to communicate with an external API
  * Use *MongoDB* instead of a relational database
  * Use *SQLAlchemy* to connect to the database
  * Something not covered in class (must be vetted by me)
