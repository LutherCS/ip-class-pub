# Fundraiser form

In this project you have to create a web application to replace the paper-based scrip form (_ScripOrderForm.pdf_). The application should be used to collect data about each purchase and store it in the database. You also must implement the manager's view of the data, including the following:

- the tuition credit information (per recipient)
- the total number/denomination of cards sold (per month)

## Requirements

While this project is open-ended and you can make certain assumptions about the requirements, some features _must_ be present.

### General

1. Database is used to store orders.
2. Consistent design using any CSS framework.
3. Deployed application.

### Seller's view

1. Ability to print the page so that the printed version of the web app would match the current form.
2. Certain fields (total amount) must be calculated and read-only.
3. Assume one form per purchaser.

### Manager's view

1. Ability to see total tuition credit for a specific student.
2. Ability to see total amount of donations made to the general fund and the all-students fund.
3. Ability to see total number of cards sold during a specific date range.
4. Ability to see total number of cards from different merchants.
