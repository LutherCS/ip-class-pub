# Midterm Mashup

## Idea

Use any open web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and fuse them together, that is use the result(s) of one API request to make another one.

Here is a non-exclusive list of web APIs:

- [ProgrammableWeb - APIs, Mashups and the Web as Platform](https://www.programmableweb.com/)
- [API List: A public list of free APIs for programmers](https://apilist.fun/)
- [The Public APIs List, a curated list for the public web Apis](https://apislist.com/)
- [GitHub - public-apis/public-apis: A collective list of free APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)

## Project requirements

1. Use Bootstrap or similar framework for styling
2. Use JavaScript events and HTML input elements for interactivity
3. Use JavaScript asynchronous programming to retrieve data
4. Use JSON or XML for data exchange
5. Use at 1 API per person + 1 per team.
6. Use local storage or cookies
