# Midterm Mashup

## Idea

Use any open web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and fuse them together, that is use the result(s) of one API request to make another one.

Here is a non-exclusive list of web APIs:

- [toddmotto/public-apis: A collective list of public JSON APIs for use in web development.](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)

- [ProgrammableWeb - APIs, Mashups and the Web as Platform](https://www.programmableweb.com/)

## Project requirements

1. Use Bootstrap or similar framework for styling
2. Use JavaScript events and HTML input elements for interactivity
3. Use JavaScript asynchronous programming to retrieve data
4. Use JSON or XML for data exchange
5. Use at least 3 APIs
6. Use local storage or cookies
